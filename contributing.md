# Contributing to Clean

Please follow the guidelines strictly in order to keep the code readable for future contributors and other curious people who want to read the code.

### Guidelines for Git

Commit messages must follow these rules sourced from [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/): 

#### The seven rules of a great git commit message :

1. [Separate subject from body with a blank line](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#separate)
2. [Limit the subject line to 50 characters](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50)
3. [Capitalize the subject line](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#capitalize)
4. [Do not end the subject line with a period](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#end)
5. [Use the imperative mood in the subject line](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative)
6. [Wrap the body at 72 characters](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#wrap-72)
7. [Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how)

* **Please commit each logical change you make, however small it may be. Do not change multiple files, or multiple functions in the same file and put them in a single commit. That's what pull requests are for!**
* **Fork the repo -> Create your own branch -> Send pull requests to the `dev` branch**
* **Always pull the latest code from the dev branch before sending pull requests**

### Guidelines for Code 

* Make sure your code is compatible with StandardJS guidelines. You can use the Standard-JS linter for that. [Find it here](standardjs.com)
* Follow camelCase for naming variables
* Variable and function names should be descriptive
* For a template you can look at how the previous code has been written
